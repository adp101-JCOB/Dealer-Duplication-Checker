# Dealer-Duplication-Checker

Overview

This project is a Python-based data cleaning tool built to support JCOB Cycling’s dealer outreach. The goal is simple: make sure new dealer leads don’t overlap with existing customers, so outreach efforts stay focused and efficient.

As JCOB expands its dealer network, the team will continuously scrape and collect new shop leads. This script ensures that those new leads are deduplicated against the current dealer list before being added to CRM or contacted.
